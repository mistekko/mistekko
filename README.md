Hi,
I'm @mistekko
I don't use cool programming languages but I program stuff anyways and, somehow, it works.
I'm currently learning Common Lisp (so that I can eventually use a cool programming language) and improving my Python.

My workflow consists solely of Emacs, Dolphin, and a terminal; each serves one function and serves it quite well.
